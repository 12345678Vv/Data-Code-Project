## General Information
My chosen artefact that I creates in order to engage in a personal project that developed my coding and data skills was to explore my love of art and building/creativity via producing an interactive, moving artwork coded using Java on Processing. 

The goal for me was to create a fun and substantially detailed artwork made using code that wasn't just a boring and stationary artwork, through which I I intended to challenge myself (which I definitely did) and develop my knowledge and coding skills as a person with zero excperience with coding prior. 

I chose this project as my artefact as when watching earlier lectures in the semester I was highly captivated and inspired with an image of a motherboard which was shown to me, as to me this computer motherboard reminded me of a city in its resemblence of being arranged to look like roads and building blocks. This then sparked my idea to do a cityscape for my artwork which I had already decided to do as I enjoy art and the idea of coding an artwork (via Processing) interested me (plus I've always wanted to learn about coding and how to do it and data visualisation didn't really interest me).



## Technologies Used
- Processing 4.0.1
- Coding is Java


## Features
List the ready features here:
- 600x700 pixel moving interactive artwork
- Unique detailed building designs constructed entirely with coding of basic shapes
- Entire automatic transformation of artwork from day scene to night scene
- Looped moving car
- Flashing lights
- Looped moving sun which transforms into moon via automatic colour change and cues simulatenous tranformation of whole day-night scene

## Setup

1. Download Processing software onto computer from their website
2. Download "My Processing Artwork Coding File.pde" from repository 
3. Click to open the downloaded file and wait till screen with coding appears
4. Press the play button located towards the top left corner of the coding window to play code and make artwork appear


## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement
Areas that could be further improved / could be improved for future development and increasing complexity and detail further.

Room for improvement:
- Try coding for the background colours to change from day to night via progressive gradient colour change to be more accurate to sunset/sunrise
- Add additional cars travelling across bridge starting from different locations and code them in their design to look different for further visual interest
- Add more flashing light features across artwork and change their time millisecond speeds for differing (not simultaneous) flashing
- Add, in via creation and layering of basic shapes, fun little details like birds, people outlines doing activities etc, that change from day to night activities adding more fun visual interest and making city seem more alive


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by my project requirements, cityscapes and motherboards slightly looking like a little city.
- Many thanks to Andrew Stapleton for his help in assisting my understanding and resolving of issues in my code preventing it running and for the Processing in-website tutorials and examples as well as the endless random Youtube videos watched to try extend and develop my coding knowledge and abilities beyond 'zero experience'.
